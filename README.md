# Twitter-Analysis

In this experiment, we try to explore the tweeter data and generate insights about:

1. the topics that users associate with Mercedes-Benz (general topics and Mercedes-Benz specific products)
2. things users like/hate about the brand and its products
3. the types of users, i.e., current customers of Mercedes-Benz who own a Mercedes product, prospective customers interested in buying a Mercedes and churners who have abandoned Mercedes-Benz or are about to.

Tweeter preprocessing includes stemming, tokenization.
Then Vadar rule-based sentiment analysis,
LDA topic model is used to find out the product that users like and dislike,  
along with Benz's product list
Pretrained language models such as Bert, XLM are used to classify different user types.
